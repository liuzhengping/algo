All of a sudden, I unexpectedly woke up, actually I didn't know whether it was only a dream or reality, it just didn't seem like a dream, nor like reality, but certainly red alert was monotonously sounding throughout the ship, which was annoying, indeed. Then I quickly stood up, simultaneously thinking what was really going on then; moreover, I was completely confused and disorganised. Before I had even realized what was going on at that very moment, a voice messagge had just arrived. As soon as I heard the message, I immediately went to the bridge, where I was expected to appear as soon as possible. Fortunately, I was walking quickly enough so I arrived on time. I quickly realized that we had been brutally attacked by an unknown enemy, as a matter of fact, by a gruop of them, most likely while I had still been sleeping, so that was the reason why the red alert had automatically been triggered. Therefore, I immediately started commanding the ship before it was too late. The enemy was strongly attacking, so we apparently had to do something about that, so first I wisely ordered to destroy the enemy vessel's secondary plasma torpedoes as torpedoes mainly do major damage to ship's hull, since they are actually penetrating shields. Unfortunately, that at first sight wise tactic didn't work well enough, because the enemy vessels were erratically and swiftly maneuvering they vessels thus avoiding our torpedoes and preventing us from eventually disabling their weapons. Meanwhile, we managed to disable few of their torpedo launchers, nevertheless. However, they would eventually have to stop evading our torpedoes if they wanted to attack, since they couldn't simultaneously attack and cowardly run. Finally, they stopped evading, which I had fortunately anticipated before. Now they had two options, either to practically drop speed to zero then cowardly escape by going to high warp, or to start attacking. After we had thoroughly and carefully examined their movement and strategy, I finally made a conclusion that they are trying to escape safely sonner or later, but they were just wisely looking for the right moment. I immediately asked our helmsman, Mr. Data, to tell me in which direction are they likely to escape. Mr. Data quickly replied that they were likely to escape in direction 101-25 which was actually the direction that exactly leads to Earth. „Oh, no“, I said to myself, „we cannot let them attack our homeworld, we must react quickly“, so I instantly ordered Mr. Worf to immediately attack the enemy vessels before they go to warp. We were constantly firing both torpedoes and phasers, but the enemy vessels were unfortunately heavily absorbing most of the damage with their shields. Additionally, every time when enemy torpedo hit us, it did a direct damage to our hull, so we were practically defenseless. We all knew that we had no chance against them, so we had nothing else but to cowardly retreat from battle, thus we let our enemy to freely go attack our planet Earth. The enemy had apparently known where they were heading, so they wisely left us alone in order to get to Earth as soon as possible, before we desperately call reinforcements. And now a miracle happened; suddenly, a large group of friendly Klingon vessels had just dropped out of warp, honorably willing to help us defeat the enemy. They immediately attacked the enemy and we could just carelessly watch how the enemy vessels were being destroyed one by one. Eventually, the enemy was eliminated. We respectedly showed our gratitude to our Klingon friends and then they left. Although we were heavily damaged, fortunately we somehow managed to repair our warp engines so immediately after that we were able to travel back to Earth and to proudly report our successful mission to Starfleet.|
